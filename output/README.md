# Output

This directory has output from all the different tools. Some files can be viewed directly (the .html files), some need to be executed (the image_to_executable ones) and some need a viewer (PCAP, whitespace, ebook). The spreadsheet needs the ```spreadsheet.bas``` integrated into the ```spreadsheet.xlsm``` and the macro needs to be run.

It is better to run the examples yourself and look through the code so you understand what is going on.
